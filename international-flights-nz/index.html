    <blockquote>Flights are only counted if at least one individual on the flight is recorded as an arrival or a departure.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>Although most flights are scheduled commercial services, the numbers may also include charter services, private aircraft, cargo aircraft and other special flights.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>Flights may visit more than one overseas port, and will be counted under each. Hence, the sum across overseas ports may differ from the total number of flights.</blockquote>
