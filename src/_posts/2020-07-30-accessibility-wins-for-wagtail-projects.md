Accessibility is a big topic, which can be hard to approach. In this talk we’ll focus on improvements specifically for Wagtail and Django projects, which you can easily apply to your own work.

Along the way we'll learn about,

- Why we care about making accessible sites and apps
- Tooling and techniques to assess the accessibility of Wagtail projects
- Accessibility considerations when modelling a site’s content and creating templates
