This is more of an announcement rather than a post: I'm now a regular contributor to [Springload's blog](http://www.springload.co.nz/blog).

<!-- more -->

The posts are a good mix of code, web design, user experience, and day to day agency life. My first post is about [picking stable front-end technologies](http://www.springload.co.nz/blog/a-stable-front-end-stack-for-2016/), and there are many more in the making!
