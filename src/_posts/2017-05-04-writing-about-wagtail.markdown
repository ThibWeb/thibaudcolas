I'm doing more and more of it!

Here are two recent posts I'm very proud of:

- [Awesome Wagtail](https://www.springload.co.nz/blog/awesome-wagtail/)
- [Bringing our mad skillz to Wagtail](https://www.springload.co.nz/blog/bringing-our-mad-skillz-wagtail/)

Both come from my involvement with Wagtail development sprints (as a member of the core developer team), in the Netherlands and Iceland. It's great to be a part of this â€“ more to come!
