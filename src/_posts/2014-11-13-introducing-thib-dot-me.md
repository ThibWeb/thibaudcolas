Here it is after a lot of commits: the new version of my personal website, [thib.me](https://thib.me/)! I've been working on it for some months and am really happy to release it.

<!-- more -->

Here are the most important changes with the reasoning behind them:

* Now in English! — mandatory because I'm relocating to New Zealand.
* Domain name changed to [thib.me](https://thib.me) — shorter, better, stronger.
* New somewhat flat design — just looks nice?
* New content focused on my skills and projects — was desperatelly needed.

This new version is my attempt at giving useful information about myself — who I am, what I like to do, some projects. This information is very different from what can be found in this blog, and aimed at a different audience (HR people, my mom). I also find it very fun to take the time to tinker every little bit of the site.

Full list of what I tried to do / how I did it / with what tools:

* Full english site
* Shorter domain name
* Mobile first (thanks [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/))
* Flat design (heavily inspired by [Anna Debenham's site](http://maban.co.uk/))
* Card-based design (inspired by experiments like [this codepen](http://codepen.io/bennettfeely/pen/Ftczh))
* Publicize my [blog](https://thib.me/) and [talks](https://thib.me/talks/)
* Many performance optimizations
* [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) for stylesheets
* [ES6](https://github.com/lukehoban/es6features) for JavaScript
* [Browserify](http://browserify.org/) for modules
* [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io/0.12/index.html) + [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/) for unit tests
* [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) for developer tooling
* Delivered by CDN thanks to [CloudFlare](http://cloudflare.com/)
* HTTPS-enabled, thanks to CloudFlare again
* Et j'en passe

I'm really proud of this new site and hope it'll help me land a great job in New Zealand!
