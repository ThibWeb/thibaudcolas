I love dataviz, especially when it is both full of insights and easily accessible to a wide audience. Here are some examples of particularly engaging visualisations I collated, ordered by technique used.

## Engaging techniques, examplified

### Interactive / gamified viz

The NY Times “You Draw It” format is a great example of how simple interactions can lead to profound insights.

- [NY Times – You Draw It: How Family Income Predicts Children’s College Chances](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/05/28/upshot/you-draw-it-how-family-income-affects-childrens-college-chances.html)
- [NY Times — You Draw It: What Got Better or Worse During Obama’s Presidency](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/01/15/us/politics/you-draw-obama-legacy.html)

### Data Gifs / “animated shorts”

- [Lena Groeger – Data Gifs](http://lenagroeger.com/datagifs/)
- [NY Times — Katie Ledecky's world record 400-meter freestyle swim](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/08/sports/olympics/katie-ledecky-400-freestyle-swimming-record.html)

### Scrollytelling

Scrollytelling is [unpopular](https://eagereyes.org/blog/2016/the-scrollytelling-scourge) in dataviz circles. But it’s still widely used. If well done (eg. a viz combined with actually-scrolling text on the page), it can work really well.

- [Washington Post – These lawmakers might want to consider crossing the aisle in the 115th Congress](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/endangered-seats/)
- [The Guardian – The dark side of Guardian comments](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/apr/12/the-dark-side-of-guardian-comments)

### Visualising social media

In this case, “social media” often means Twitter.

- [Dataveyes – A real-time visualization of the France vs. Switzerland football match](http://dataveyes.com/#!/en/projects/twitter)
- [Dataviz.love – Hillary vs Trump: The Game of Tweets](http://dataviz.love/2017/02/05/hillary-vs-trump-the-game-of-tweets/)

## Building your own: factors to consider

There are specific things to consider to make a visualisation / infographic compelling, based on what type of data is available.

- Do we have geolocalised data? Maps are both great-looking and very easy to understand.
- Do we have personal data? A piece is more compelling if it allows comparison of the viewer’s details or demographic to the rest.
- Do we have live data? If the data updates in any way it will be more interesting to come back.
- How well does it have to work on mobile? There isn’t as much space there.
- How much does your audience know? If they stumble upon it, will they be able to understand it?
