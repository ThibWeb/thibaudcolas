While working on yet another React project using [`react-router`](https://github.com/reactjs/react-router/), I discovered ±3kb of minified warning messages / development aids in my JavaScript bundle.

<!-- more -->

As it turns out, React's practice of having different code for "development mode" and "production" is being used by other projects from community members, but not with the same level of caution – for this tooling to work, the build steps need to use specific configuration: https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/package-management.html.

Not all projects mention this, and more importantly not all projects warn you if you don't. The solution? Configure your build step to remove those development aids in _the entire bundle_, and not just your own code.
