Three months ago, I started mentoring another developer. It went great, but I was always wondering how to _quantify_, or at least evaluate how good (/bad) this mentoring effort was. I am now mentoring multiple people and I want to see how their performance evolves over time, how their knowledge expands.

I stumbled upon a great collection of [Front-end Job Interview Questions](https://github.com/darcyclarke/Front-end-Developer-Interview-Questions) put together by many contributors on GitHub. For now, this post is just a subset of those questions that I like best, with answer suggestions where it feels appropriate, plus some of my own questions.
