The end of the year seems to be a good time to turn back and have a look at what those last 365 days were made of. I'll keep my 9-to-5 job out of the picture (I quit!) and just focus on what happened around OSS/GitHub and my personal projects.

<!-- more -->

In 2014:

- My blog got [13 new blog posts](/archives/).
- I did [4 talks](/talks/) at various events.
- I created [34 PRs](https://github.com/thibaudcolas?tab=overview&from=2010-12-01&to=2010-12-31) for many projects on GitHub.
- My [main website](https://thib.me) was rebuilt from scratch.
- I did a **lot** of side-projects:
  - [Zori](https://github.com/FlipFlopWeekly/zori)
  - [JS1K](https://github.com/thibaudcolas/js1k-2014)
  - Something cool in Python: [When will it be done?](http://whenwillitbedone.trgdy.com/)
  - [JS13K](https://github.com/FatBoyCrew/elements-shmup)
  - A theme for jsonresume.org: [Eloquent](https://github.com/thibaudcolas/jsonresume-theme-eloquent)

Here's what my GitHub scorecard looks like:

Oh and, yeah, I quit my job in France and moved to New Zealand. Hopefully 2015 will be a beautiful year over here in Auckland.
