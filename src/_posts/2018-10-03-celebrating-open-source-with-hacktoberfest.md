The skies are getting darker, the air is getting colder. It’s October! To counter the winter blues, we had a celebration of open source with Hacktoberfest.

## Hacktoberfest?

[Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) is a month-long event from DigitalOcean, GitHub, and Twilio. It’s real simple: contribute to 5 open-source projects over the month, and receive a free limited edition T-shirt. At Codemate, we love open source, and also love t-shirts; it made perfect sense for us to get involved and help organise the [Hacktoberfest Open Hack Night](https://www.meetup.com/Oulu-Web-Development/events/254437471/) from Oulu’s local Web Dev meetup.

## Supporting open source

Open source contributions don’t have to be complicated to be meaningful. Anyone can contribute to an effort they care about. It’s a great way to give back to projects we benefit from, and also to learn new things. During the workshop, participants made pull requests to various projects like Joonas’ [LunchWatch](https://github.com/jtiala/lunchwatch-client).

We hope to help organise more of those events in the future. In the meantime, if you want to learn more about Codemate and open source check out what we have shared on GitHub – for example [FlutterMates](https://github.com/CodemateLtd/FlutterMates).
