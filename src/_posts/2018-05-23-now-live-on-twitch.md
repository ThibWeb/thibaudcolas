Starting this week, I'm trying out programming livestreams on Twitch: [https://www.twitch.tv/thibaudcolas](https://www.twitch.tv/thibaudcolas).

<!-- more -->

This is something I wanted to try for a while, and with my open-source work becoming more visible via Patreon I thought now was a good time to get started. I have been watching video game streams on Twitch, and also programming (for example [noopkat](https://www.twitch.tv/noopkat)) and quite enjoyed the format â€“ it's interactive, you share knowledge, and it doesn't require much video editing skills. People are much more forgiving because of it being live.

For the first stream, we focused on [Copy-paste improvements for Draft.js / Draftail](https://github.com/springload/draftail/issues/147), which is one of this month's most popular goals. I had already done some promising work on this, so the stream was an opportunity for me to talk through why this is such a complicated fix, provide some background info on Draft.js as a projectâ€¦ and write some code. All in all, in 2 hours, we wrote about 10 lines ðŸ˜… [https://github.com/thibaudcolas/draftjs-conductor/pull/2/commits/7ce0af429c5262c5077766fdab31fdff19bdd898](https://github.com/thibaudcolas/draftjs-conductor/pull/2/commits/7ce0af429c5262c5077766fdab31fdff19bdd898).

There were even some people watching:

For the next stream â€“ I'm looking for ideas! Please [vote on Twitter](https://twitter.com/thibaud_colas/status/999222328415391744), and if you want to see more of those types of streams in general consider supporting me on Patreon. You can follow me on Twitch and-or Twitter ([@thibaudcolas](https://twitter.com/thibaud_colas)) to know when the next stream will be.
