  <h1>Food-related expenses forecast</h1>
  <div id="viz"></div>
  <p>Input data is each food-related expense, and daily food budget (budget per meal * number of meals).</p>
  <p>Expenses are then spread on the days they (should) cover, according to the daily food budget.</p>
  <p>If multiple expenses cover the same day, the day's food expense increases above the daily food budget threshold.</p>
  <h2>Todo</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Use euclidian division and properly take remainder into account when daily budget is not a multiple of expense amount.</li>
    <li>Handle the case where expenses cover a longer period than they should.</li>
    <li>Refine color quantization to use less colors.</li>
    <li>Add a threshold to have two categories: days below and above daily food budget.</li>
    <li>Properly draw month borders.</li>
    <li>Add more labels</li>
    <li>SPAify</li>
  </ul>
